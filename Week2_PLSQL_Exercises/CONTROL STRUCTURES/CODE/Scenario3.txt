Scenario 3: The bank wants to send reminders to customers whose loans are due within the next 30 days.
o	Question: Write a PL/SQL block that fetches all loans due in the next 30 days and prints a reminder message for each customer.

CREATE TABLE loans (
    loan_id       NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id   NUMBER,
    due_date      DATE,
    amount        NUMBER(10,2)
);
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id   NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name          VARCHAR2(100)
);
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1, 'Ravi');
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (2, 'Meena');
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (3, 'Anil');
INSERT INTO loans VALUES (101, 1, SYSDATE + 10, 50000);
INSERT INTO loans VALUES (102, 2, SYSDATE + 40, 30000);
INSERT INTO loans VALUES (103, 3, SYSDATE + 5, 25000);
COMMIT;
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
   CURSOR loan_cur IS
      SELECT l.loan_id, l.due_date, l.amount, c.name
      FROM loans l
      JOIN customers c ON l.customer_id = c.customer_id
      WHERE l.due_date BETWEEN SYSDATE AND SYSDATE + 30;

BEGIN
   FOR loan_rec IN loan_cur LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Reminder: ' || loan_rec.name || 
         ', your loan (ID: ' || loan_rec.loan_id || 
         ') of $' || loan_rec.amount || 
         ' is due on ' || TO_CHAR(loan_rec.due_date, 'DD-Mon-YYYY') || '.');
   END LOOP;
