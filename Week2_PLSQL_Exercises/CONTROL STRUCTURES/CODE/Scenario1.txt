Scenario 1: The bank wants to apply a discount to loan interest rates for customers above 60 years old.
o	Question: Write a PL/SQL block that loops through all customers, checks their age, and if they are above 60, apply a 1% discount to their current loan interest rates.

CREATE TABLE customers (
   customer_id   NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
   name          VARCHAR2(100),
   age           NUMBER,
   loan_interest NUMBER(5,2)
);
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1, 'Ravi', 65, 9.5);
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (2, 'Meena', 45, 10.0);
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (3, 'Anil', 70, 8.5);
COMMIT;
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
   CURSOR cust_cur IS
      SELECT customer_id, age, loan_interest
      FROM customers;
BEGIN
   FOR cust_rec IN cust_cur LOOP
      IF cust_rec.age > 60 THEN
         UPDATE customers
         SET loan_interest = loan_interest - 1
         WHERE customer_id = cust_rec.customer_id;

         DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Discount applied to customer ID: ' || cust_rec.customer_id);
      ELSE
         DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No discount for customer ID: ' || cust_rec.customer_id);
      END IF;
   END LOOP;
   COMMIT;
END;
